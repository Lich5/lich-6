Unchanged ecleanse setup fixture

`ecleanse_setup.lic` is the exact `Ecleanse::Setup` module at lines 267–623 of
[`scripts/ecleanse.lic` at 7fd0b971387492cfd81b4bc7ef94428413965071](https://github.com/elanthia-online/scripts/blob/7fd0b971387492cfd81b4bc7ef94428413965071/scripts/ecleanse.lic).
It includes the complete XML and original settings, change, Close and destroy
handlers. Do not simplify the XML or rewrite callbacks to accommodate the shim.

Provenance checks:

- Original whole-script SHA-256: `64e7b1d920bed944b8b33bf9a192c13bb23289d932e6873f38d61579971da4bf`.
- `Setup.ui` SHA-256: `1dec1310d30d6b3f1e34beb7a39aeccdffdd6da70e87c476818759405be13eea` (25,513 bytes).
- The Builder regression asserts the XML digest and 54 constructed objects.

The RSpec harness supplies inert game lookups, a temporary settings directory and
message capture; it does not execute the script's game loop. Unit tests exercise
initialization, changes and close lifecycle. The explicit Chrome run drives the
same controls and original callbacks through the production WebUI transport.
Passing these tests demonstrates setup support, not whole-script gameplay or
native desktop-window parity.

Unchanged ewaggle setup fixture

`ewaggle_setup.lic` is the exact setup section (lines 199–634) of the retained
original GTK script, including Builder XML, original initialization, signals,
list-transfer handlers and save/destroy behavior. No callbacks were rewritten.
Whole-script SHA-256: fe74b93bbc73ce83981ff8e23dba11dcc0e51a905454685afb39988eb87726e4.
Setup.ewaggle_ui SHA-256: c617157ee342adb4bfcb9d3281de5d63c17ef777d4f75fcad60544ec6049eddf
(28,928 bytes; 77 constructed objects).
The harness substitutes game lookups and Ewaggle.save_profile's destination only.
Chrome exercises prefix search, cross-list drag/drop, same-list duplication,
named ComboBox selection, numeric edits and the original Close callback.
Ruby also verifies destruction without saving and unsupported input refusal.
These checks establish setup behavior, not casting-loop or whole-script acceptance.
